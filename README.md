# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables - 
		A variable is a container to hold something. Let say we want to hold some water. We have a few choices as what to put it in. We could use a jug, cup, bowl, or 
		even a plastic baggie. These objects would be considered a variable. We could also switch what each variable or container holds as well. We could pour the water
		out of the cup and put milk in it instead. Now the variable of "cup" contains the "value" of milk. 

	* Strings -
		String are a type of variable. They are used to hold text. If we want to store a word or phrase then we do so in a container reffered to as a string.
		
	* Functions (arguments, `return`) -
		Functions are a set of instructions designed to accomplish a task. These instructions can be reused multiple times. Say we had a program that we add 
		two numbers a bunch of times. Instead of writing the code out seperately for each math problem we could create a function to keep reuse each time we
		need to do the math. This is a way of saving lots of time and coding. A good rule of thumb is if you have repeating code in your program then maybe
		you should try to make a function to handle that code.
 
	* `if` statements -
		If statements are used to test if something is true or false. If the statement passes as true we can do something, and if false we could do something 
		else. Your mother might use an if statement like this: "If you do your homework you can have some icecream, and if you do not do your homework no icecream for you".

	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) - 
		Boolean values are a type of variable that can only hold two different values. The value is either True of False. You can think of it like a light bulb.
		Either the light is on (true), or off (false).


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Install SublimeText3.  If you have another editor that you prefer then you can use that. https://www.sublimetext.com/3


4. Download this project folder from GitHub.


5. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


6. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
